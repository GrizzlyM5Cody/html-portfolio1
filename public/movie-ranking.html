<h1>The Best Movies According to Cameron</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>TopGun 2</h3>
<p>For having me on the edge of my seat, during the flight, and throughout the scenes with the jets. Ienjoyed the backstory as well.
</p>
<h3>Yellow-Jacket</h3>
<p>Just because i couldnt think of anything else, Ive watched lately, kind of trippy though, good watch up until the ending of s2</p>
<h3>Cobra Kai</h3>
<p>Sink yourself into the couch for 106 hours, for some feel good family drama & karate dojo mayhem, like it for the retro 90s felt similar to the OG karate kid w/backstories making this pretty interesting</p>

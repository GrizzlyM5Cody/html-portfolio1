<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hi! My name is Cameron Stites, I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer, Which Covers Front-End and Back-End Development. I'm Self-taught currently working on HTML and CSS.
  In the beginning stages still,however I'm setting aside time each day, to learn more & more!
  I'd love to design my own Websites and become a god-level programmer some day. Im excited to become more knowledgable in this field and grow with
  the support of my loving wife
</p>

<p>Along the way I will list my Certifications, accomplishments and struggles. More than likely redoing this pages completely
  however, I've also considered blogging about the overall path I've taken. To one day be an example to others who are as passionate about coding as I am.
  Since im using the rest of this as filler, to fill in paragraphs about "myself" I thought it would be funny for the final paragraph to be
  written in Bro Ipsum </p>
